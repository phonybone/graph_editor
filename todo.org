* refactor edge-drawing code to edge class, likewise nodes
* implement class-based style attributes where appropriate, eg stroke, stroke-width, fill, etc
* implement inheritance of constructorsxb
  
* Right-click on nodes to bring up pop-up menus
- allow editing of raw attributes
- allow performing of operations on node

* Aggregate nodes: sub-graphs

* How to set graphics attributes of nodes (and edges)?
Want to have drawables draw themselves; best way to specify attributes?
Could sub-class...
Want to allow user to define a particular type of node:
- shape, fill, stroke, stroke-width
-- shapes: rect, circle, poly-line, ellipse, pre-defined poly-lines (diamond, rhombus, triangle, pent-, hex-, sep-, octogons, etc)
- could also be an image/icon
- could be computed attribute?
- random attributes (eg name, genetic info, whatever user wants)
- upload from file...

* drag-n-drop existing nodes
* select node sets
- manually
- by selecting attribute values

* DND to create nodes/edges
* bio editor: adding in data sources, ajax calls, sessions, etc.

* stress testing
